I use arch linux and the install.sh script will only work for arch or arch-based systems since it utilizes pacman (archs package manager)


## Install


```console
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

> Encase you only want to install packages or only stow packages, then you have to chmod +x*<file>*for which ever *file* you'd want to run. (If you for some reason would rather do this you have to do additional setup, look in install.sh script for more info)
